# Convolution Long Short-Term Memory Networks (CNN-LSTM)

This repository contains code for a Convolution Long Short-Term Memory Networks (CNN-LSTM) 
deep learning model. 

## Overview 

Although CNN are traditionally used in computer vision for image related tasks, they can also be applied to a wide range of other challenges [1]. CNN utilizes convolution to captures local features and pooling to prevent redundancy. A stack of LSTMs is then connected to the end of CNN with the hopes of capturing sequential relationships. 

We utilized the [DARTS](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/) [2] to  enhance functionality and streamline development. Our model can be
used in similar form as all other DARTS Forecasting Models.
